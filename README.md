### Udacity machine learning training projects in 2017

#### Project 1: [Boston Housing](https://github.com/yzzhang/machine-learning/blob/master/boston_housing/report.pdf)
This project evaluates the performance and predictive power of a Decision Tree model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

#### Project 2: [Finding Donors](https://github.com/yzzhang/machine-learning/blob/master/finding_donors/report.pdf)
In this project, first several supervised algorithms are employed to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then the best candidate algorithm is chosen from preliminary results and further optimized to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features.

#### Project 3: [Customer Segments](https://github.com/yzzhang/machine-learning/blob/master/customer_segments/report.pdf)
This project analyzes a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
