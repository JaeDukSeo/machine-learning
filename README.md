### Udacity machine learning training projects in 2017

#### Project 1: [Boston Housing](https://github.com/yzzhang/machine-learning/blob/master/boston_housing/report.pdf)
This project evaluates the performance and predictive power of a Decision Tree model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. 

#### Project 3: [Customer Segments](https://github.com/yzzhang/machine-learning/blob/master/customer_segments/report.pdf)
This project analyzes a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
